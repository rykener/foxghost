## Covid Protocol
All participants must be fully vaccinated with booster shots. We adopt the rules of the space that we're using, as such masks are currently **not required**. Regardless, **please bring a K/N95 mask with you** as this guideline may change in order to help make our space more inclusive.

## Facillitators
Trans Sangha is co-facilitated by temple resident Kei Van Arnam and former resident Eleanor Shonin Rykener, both trans women. We are students in the Soto Zen Buddhist lineage.

## Meditation Style/Instruction
Any meditation instruction we give in the group will be based on Shikantaza (Silent Illumination), the traditional meditation practice of Soto Zen. You are not required to meditate in that tradition in order to participate. All we ask is that you remain silent during the meditation period.

For the time being we will be providing light guided meditation during our 20 minute meditation sessions.

If you would like to receive more in-depth meditation instruction please let one of the facilitators know. Meditation should be inclusive, we will attempt to adapt the instruction to any specific needs.

## Accessibility

**Main Space**

We meet in an indoor space that has two small air purifiers running and a small window that will be open. If covid concerns will prevent you from joining please [reach out to us](mailto:transsangha@gmail.com) so that we can make accommodations.

The temple is located on a moderately steep San Francisco hill. There are approximately 8 steps to get to the main floor of the temple from the sidewalk. There is a ramp available for use, however it must be unlocked by a temple staff member. If you would like to utilize the ramp please [contact us](mailto:transsangha@gmail.com) before attending so that we can be ready to unlock it for you.

Once inside our meeting space there are comfortable chairs to sit in with no arm rests. There are also a small number of meditation cushions available for sitting on the floor.

**Secondary Space**

It is very likely that we will soon run out of room for everyone in our preferred meeting space. There is a chance that we will have to move to a building next door with little notice. This building is just up the hill and has around 10 steps or so, which are steeper than at the main space. There are fewer chairs in this building, most seating will be on meditation cushions on the floor. Please let us know if you'll need a chair so that we can ensure there's space for you. This building is not wheelchair accessible. We are actively searching for solutions for our space problem. Please contact us if you have *any* accessibility concerns so that we can be proactive about finding solutions.
