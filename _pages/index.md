## Joining / Updates
Drop-ins are welcome! We try to keep this website as up-to-date as possible.

We use a read-only Signal group to send updates to interested people. If you have Signal downloaded you can [use this link](https://signal.group/#CjQKICYH4BMbBk2x0wwIzPQT26q-4Bv-f8yC493EyGR5WMuyEhCEzV1c3QgZEuN1McLCru51) to request being added to the group.

The Signal group is *not* a group chat.

Signal is a security-focused, open-source chat application similar to WhatsApp but not owned by a billionaire. It's commonly used in both trans and activist circles for organizing. You can download Signal for [iPhone here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669) or [Android here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms).

## Covid Protocol
**K/N95 masks are required**. All participants must be fully vaccinated with booster shots.

## Facilitators
Trans Sangha is co-facilitated by temple resident Kei Van Arnam and former resident Eleanor Shonin Rykener, both white trans women. We are students in the Soto Zen Buddhist lineage.

We are not Buddhist teachers.

## Meditation Style/Instruction
Any meditation instruction we give in the group will be based on or inspired by Shikantaza (Silent Illumination), the traditional meditation practice of Soto Zen. You are not required to meditate in that tradition in order to participate. All we ask is that you remain silent during the meditation period.

For the time being we will be providing light, guided meditation during our 20-30 minute meditation sessions.

If you would like to receive more in-depth meditation instruction please let one of the facilitators know. Meditation should be inclusive, we will attempt to adapt the instruction to any specific needs.

## Accessibility

To help protect people who are immunocompromised all participants are required to wear masks and have full vaccinations + boosters.

In order to respect people with multiple chemical sensitives and related conditions, this is a **scent-free** community. Please do not arrive wearing perfume, cologne, heavily scented laundry detergent, or smelling of smoke. People who do not follow this guideline may be asked to leave.

### **Main Space Accessibility**

We meet in an indoor space that has two small air purifiers running and a small window that will be open.  

The temple is located on a moderately steep San Francisco hill. There are approximately 8 steps to get to the main floor of the temple from the sidewalk. There is a ramp available for use, however it must be unlocked by a temple staff member. If you would like to utilize the ramp please [contact us](mailto:transsangha@gmail.com) before attending so that we can be ready to unlock it for you.

Once inside our meeting space there are comfortable chairs to sit in with no arm rests. There are also a small number of meditation cushions available for sitting on the floor.

### **Secondary Space Accessibility**

It is very likely that we will soon run out of room for everyone in our preferred meeting space. There is a chance that we will have to move to a building next door with little notice. This building is just up the hill and has around 10 steps or so, which are steeper than at the main space. There are fewer chairs in this building, most seating will be on meditation cushions on the floor. Please let us know if you'll need a chair so that we can ensure there's space for you. This building is not wheelchair accessible. We are actively searching for solutions for our space problem. Please contact us if you have *any* accessibility concerns so that we can be proactive about finding solutions.
