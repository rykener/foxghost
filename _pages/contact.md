The group communicates primarily through a Signal chat.

To ask questions or to get plugged into the group chat please send an email to [contact@foxghost.org](mailto:contact@foxghost.org).

**Signal** is a simple, open-source messenger app that has full end-to-end encryption and great group features. It's commonly used in trans communities to have private, cross-platform discussions. [Download Signal here](https://signal.org/install).
