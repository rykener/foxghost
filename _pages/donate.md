## Donate

Donations are appreciated but not required. The facillitators do not take any of the money, but instead put it back into the group for when expenses come up, such as reimbursing folks who buy snacks for the sangha.

We currently only accept Venmo at this time, and we ask that you not send more than $10 per meeting. It goes into Eleanor's personal Venmo until we figure something else out. 

Send the vemo to [@rykener](https://account.venmo.com/u/rykener) with the note "dana" (which means generosity in Pali) so she knows what the payment is for.


## Volunteer

A volunteer is needed for preparing snacks & tea and a second volunteer is needed for desk duty. Eleanor will reimburse snacks out of the Dana pool, up to $25? How much do snacks cost?

## Volunteer Instructions:

### Tea & Snack Instructions 

Your job is to prepare and provide treats to give the community something to gather around once the meeting is over. Having this time is essential to the community building we're aiming to do, and you are the facillitator of that. 

A snack can be savory or sweet, cookies seems to be common but please have fun with it. You can make it yourself or buy at the store. Our latest meetings have seen around 15-20 people. Please make a small sign that lists all common allergens, such as sugar (and other sweeteners), nuts, gluten, eggs, dairy, etc. Double check the allergens so as to not accidentally hurt someone. 

Come early to get tea kettles, bags, and cups ready. These are stored in the small kitchen, someone who's done this job can show you where those things and the hot water are. 

When we start announcements at the end of the meeting you can get up and leave to get the tea and snack ready. Stage the snack, tea, and cups on the desk in the lobby. 

Once things are winding down, recruit a few folks to help you clean up. Ask a facillitator if you need help recruiting. Cups and kettles should go through the sanitizer in the main kitchen and then be put away. 

### Desk Duty Instructions

Your job is to be the face of the trans sangha for the evening. This helps make new folks feel welcome and lets them know they're in the right place. Cis people will likely talk to you.

Arrive early, around 6:40. Gain access to the temple by ringing the doorbell. Put the sign up on the front door as well as one on the desk. There's a sign up sheet for the Signal group and a donation sign that should be out on the desk as well. If you don't see these on the desk, Kei will drop them off soon.

Make sure the door is unlocked by either putting a stone in the doorway or proping the door open if the weather is nice. 

Sit at the desk and greet people. Some people will casually approach you like they're waiting for something to happen, those are generally the people who are showing up for the first time. Ask them what program they're here for (there are ocassionaly other programs on thursday nights) and if they're here for Trans Sangha do the following:

1) make sure they're wearing a K/N95 mask. If they don't have one, provide one that will be on the desk. (other guests to the temple are not currently required to wear them!)
2) point them to the room we're meeing in, and make sure they know to take off their shoes before entering.
3) point out where the restrooms are
4) ask if they have any questions
5) be really nice, you're the first impression the person will have of the community we're building.

Stay seated until about 5 minutes after the group starts meditating in case there are any stragglers. After this point, please fully close the front door to the temple to ensure that it's locked. Enter the room we're meeting in and sit near-ish to the door. If the doorbell rings during the meditation, please get up to answer the door. If it's someone there for trans sangha say what's up etc and then come back into the room. 

P.S. You may encounter someone delivering packages. Just instruct them to put the boxes on the ground by the office that is just to your 2 o'clock when sitting at the desk
