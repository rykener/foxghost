## Donate

Donations are appreciated but not required. The facillitators do not take any of the money, but instead put it back into the group for when expenses come up, such as reimbursing folks who buy snacks for the sangha.

We currently only accept Venmo at this time, and we ask that you not send more than $10 per meeting. It goes into Eleanor's personal Venmo until we figure something else out. 

Send the vemo to [@rykener](https://account.venmo.com/u/rykener) with the note "dana" (which means generosity in Pali) so she knows what the payment is for.
