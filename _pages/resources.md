### Other Dharma Books

* Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind by Suzuki Roshi -- this book is historically one of the most important entry gates to Buddhist practice in English-speaking Zen. It is a series of transcribed talks given by the founder of the San Francisco Zen Center.
* Introduction to Zen Koans by James Ford -- A wonderful and practical primer on not just the Zen practice of koans but of Zen in general. Highly recommended if you're interested in learning more about Zen, not _just_ the "spirit" of Zen.
* Transcending: Trans Buddhist Voices edited by Kevin Manders and Elizabeth Marston -- a collection of essays and reflections written by transgender Buddhist practitioners of varying experiences. While the trans population has been severely (but not entirely) barred from entry into becoming authorized Buddhist teachers, it is interesting to read about how the practice has still impacted our lives. Each essay is hit or miss on quality, but it's still touching.
